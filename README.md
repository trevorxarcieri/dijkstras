  ## Requirements Deviations
  **There are no requirements deviations.** Still, there are a couple interesting features that I believe set this project apart from the minimum implied by the project description, and I'd like to highlight those here:

  ## Notes to Run the Program
  * I used gcc on my Linux machine, and my command to run the program was the following:
      `gcc -fdiagnostics-color=always -g Project2.c -o Project2.o -lm -lstdc++ -std=c++17; ./Project2.o`
