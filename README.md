  ## Requirements Deviations
  **There are no requirements deviations.** In addition to meeting the requirements, there is additional functionality, mainly in random graph generation. I encourage you to run the program yourself multiple times and see the variability in graph construction.

  ## Notes to Run the Program
  * I used gcc on my Linux machine, and my command to run the program was the following:
      `gcc -fdiagnostics-color=always -g Project2.c -o Project2.o -lm -lstdc++ -std=c++17; ./Project2.o`
